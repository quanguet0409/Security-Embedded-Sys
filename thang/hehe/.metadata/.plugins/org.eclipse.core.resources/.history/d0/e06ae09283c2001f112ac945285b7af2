/**
* @file xgpio_example.c
*
* This file contains a design example using the AXI GPIO driver (XGpio) and
* hardware device.  It only uses channel 1 of a GPIO device and assumes that
* the bit 0 of the GPIO is connected to the LED on the HW board.
*
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a rmm  03/13/02 First release
* 1.00a rpm  08/04/03 Removed second example and invalid macro calls
* 2.00a jhl  12/15/03 Added support for dual channels
* 2.00a sv   04/20/05 Minor changes to comply to Doxygen and coding guidelines
* 3.00a ktn  11/20/09 Minor changes as per coding guidelines.
* 4.1   lks  11/18/15 Updated to use canonical xparameters and
*		      clean up of the comments and code for CR 900381
* 4.3   sk   09/29/16 Modified the example to make it work when LED_bits are
*                     configured as an output. CR# 958644
*       ms   01/23/17 Added xil_printf statement in main function to
*                     ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed" strings
*                     are available in all examples. This is a fix for
*                     CR-965028.
